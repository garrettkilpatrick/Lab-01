Short Answer Section

1. A getter is a way of letting the user access a private member variable,
   while a setter is a way of letting the user set a private member variable
   without changing the original value.

2. It is a good idea to make member vairables private, because often member
   variables will contain information that the user shouldn't know (such as
   a social security number). 

3.  A constructor is a way to initialize objects.

4.  A default constructor sets the default values of the member variables.
    As far as I know, there can only be one default constructor.

5.  Constructors can be overloaded, so there can be more than one.

6.  The constructor does execute when the object is created.
